    "description": "When placing any vehicle that requires fuel (like a car or tank), you will automatically enter it and place the best available fuel and ammo in your inventory into it. This mod also adds a custom keybind that allows you to leave and mine a vehicle instantly. This mod should work with modded vehicles and fuels."
